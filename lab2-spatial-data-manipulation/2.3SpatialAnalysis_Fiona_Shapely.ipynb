    "## Using Fiona to manipuate shapefiles and do spatial analysis\n",
    "Fiona is an excellant tool for spatial manipulation. This session show you how to use fiona to read and write shapefiles. Shapely and Fiona. These libraries are essentially wrappers for GEOS and OGR, respectively, which provide clean, Pythonic interfaces for performing the processing, while still keeping the performance capabilities of the underlying libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiona is used for reading and writing vector files (here weâ€™re using Shapefiles), while Shapely is used for doing the manipulation and analysis of the geometric objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session will include some major sections, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read metadata, attributes, geometry of features in shapfile using fiona\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create shapefile based on the longitude and latitude \n",

    "1. Convert the projection of shapefiles using pyproj\n",
